\title{Compute MSigDB Collection Enrichments for each community}
\usage{
compute_MSigDB_enrichment(
  membership_matrix,
  K = 100,
  memb_cut = 0.65,
  cats = c("H", "C3", "C6", "C7", "C8")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{membership_matrix}{a community membership (kME) matrix with genes as
rows and communities as columns. Often \code{community_membership} or
\code{full_community_membership} output from \code{\link[=icwgcna]{icwgcna()}}}

\item{K}{cutoff for top community genes to include for computing enrichment.
Used in an AND condition with memb_cut.}

\item{memb_cut}{cutoff as a membership score threshold for determining top
community genes for computing enrichment.  Used in an AND condition with K.}

\item{cats}{MSigDB collections to use. We recommend only using
H, C3, C6, C7, C8 and avoiding C1, C2, C4, C5 for speed}
}
\value{
Returns a list with the following items:
\itemize{
\item \code{top_enr} - a data.frame of the most significant enrichment for each
MSigDB collection.
\item \code{full_enr} - all MSigDB enrichment scores for all communities for the
selected collections.
}
}
\description{
Compute MSigDB Collection enrichments using msigdbr
using Fisher test.
}
\details{
The function can use parallel and distributed processing in R, via the
\link[foreach:foreach]{foreach} package.

GSEA Enrichment testing assumes differential analysis so we are using simple
fisher tests instead (actually hypergeometric for speed)

library("UCSCXenaTools")
luad <- getTCGAdata(
  project = "LUAD", mRNASeq = TRUE, mRNASeqType = "normalized",

# Running with whatever parallel processing is already set up
