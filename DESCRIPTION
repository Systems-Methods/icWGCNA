Description: Iterative Correcting Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis function for constructing a gene network from a gene expression matrix. The algorithm: 
    1. Constructs a signed wgcna network.
    2. Drops correlated modules based on kurtosis.
    3. Regresses out the largest community from the expression data.
    4. Repeats steps 1-3 until a maximum number of communities or iterations is reached.
